            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>As part of the requirements for the GIS Certificate program at the University of Wisconsin Madison, I needed to complete a Capstone project. The project I designed was an investigation for an idea I proposed to my boss, Howard Veregin at the Wisconsin State Cartographer's Office for making METRIC Evapotranspiration raster datasets more readily available to the state of Wisconsin. This lead us to organize a few different phases that would need to be completed in order to realize the full idea. Due to time and the complexity of the idea, we were only able to finish the investigation portion of phase 1, with a few small steps towards implementation.</p>
