            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>For my GIS Applications course, my partner and I chose to attempt an Aquifer Model for the Central Sand and Gravel Aquifer in Wisconsin.  We were new to MODFLOW and to the FREEWAT interface that we used to model it, which posed many problems.  But what we learned along the way was invaluable experience with both MODFLOW, and hydrology modeling in general.  FREEWAT is an open source tool in QGIS that takes the USGS MODFLOW command line interface and uses QGIS graphical interface for completely georeferenced groundwater models.  To read more about our project click the link below.  To read more about FREEWAT click <a href="http://www.freewat.eu/">here</a></p>
