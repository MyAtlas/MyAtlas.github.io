			<p style="padding-top: 25px">My name is Dawson Bancroft-Short and the purpose of this website is to introduce you to the most recent life path that I have been focusing on and what I hope to be a lifelong career in GIS and cartography. I grew up flying planes with my grandfather and climbing mountains with my geologist grandmother, so maps have always played a large roll in my life. After high school, I went on to study Environmental Science at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, PA. I played hockey all four years, and for this reason, I have chosen hockey as my theme for my interactive CV map shown below. It was also the only time I saw a chance to be able to make a hockey map in my near future!</p>

			<p style="padding-top: 25px">My time at the University of Wisconsin GIS certificate program has also connected many dots to my background in Environmental Science as well as how to apply them. I am a very open minded person who seeks to constantly keep learning new things and for that reason, I am open to any GIS or cartography opportunity that comes my way. I have a work ethic like an athlete and a mind like a scientist, so I look forward to seeing where I will end up applying these skills. I currently work for the Wisconsin State Cartographer's Office as a student GIS developer where I have worked with SQL, PostGreSQL, shell scripting, python, html, css, and javascript. I am not an expert in any of these, but I have a solid foundation laid for each.<p>
